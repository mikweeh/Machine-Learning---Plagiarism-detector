# Machine-Learning---Plagiarism-detector
Second project of Udacity's nanodegree "Machine learning engineer" developed on april 26th, 2020.


__Plagiarism Detection__

__Project Overview__

In this project, you will be tasked with building a plagiarism detector that examines a text file and performs binary classification; labeling that file as either plagiarized or not, depending on how similar the text file is to a provided source text.


__Getting the Project Materials__

You have been given starting notebooks in a Github repository, linked below.

    Since this project uses SageMaker, it is suggested that you create a new SageMaker notebook instance using your AWS console and link it to the Github repository https://github.com/udacity/ML_SageMaker_Studies.

The project files are in the Project_Plagiarism_Detection directory.


__Project Development__

Although the project only required working with one model, it has been developed with four different Scikit-Learn models, evaluating the differences between them and selecting the most appropriate for the requested task.
